	Abstract = {Abstract A number of recent works have investigated the notion of 
``computational fields'' as a means of coordinating systems in distributed, dense 
and dynamic environments such as pervasive computing, sensor networks, and robot 
swarms. We introduce a minimal core calculus meant to capture the key 
ingredients of languages that make use of computational fields: functional 
composition of fields, functions over fields, evolution of fields over time, 
construction of fields of values from neighbours, and restriction of a field 
computation to a sub-region of the network. We formalise a notion of type 
soundness for the calculus that encompasses the concept of domain alignment, and 
present a sound static type inference system. This calculus and its type 
inference system can act as a core for actual implementation of coordination 
languages and models, as well as to pave the way towards formal analysis of 
properties concerning expressiveness, self-stabilisation, topology independence, 
and relationships with the continuous space--time semantics of spatial 
computations. },

	Abstract = {Bigraphs are graphs whose nodes may be nested, representing locality, independently of the edges connecting them. They may be equipped with reaction rules, forming a bigraphical reactive system (Brs) in which bigraphs can reconfigure themselves. Following an earlier paper describing link graphs, a constituent of bigraphs, this paper is a devoted to pure bigraphs, which in turn underlie various more refined forms. Elsewhere it is shown that behavioural analysis for Petri nets, π-calculus and mobile ambients can all be recovered in the uniform framework of bigraphs. The paper first develops the dynamic theory of an abstract structure, a wide reactive system (Wrs), of which a Brs is an instance. In this context, labelled transitions are defined in such a way that the induced bisimilarity is a congruence. This work is then specialised to Brss, whose graphical structure allows many refinements of the theory. The latter part of the paper emphasizes bigraphical theory that is relevant to the treatment of dynamics via labelled transitions. As a running example, the theory is applied to finite pure CCS, whose resulting transition system and bisimilarity are analysed in detail. The paper also mentions briefly the use of bigraphs to model pervasive computing and biological systems. },

	Abstract = {More and more aspects of concurrency and concurrent programming are becoming part of mainstream programming and software engineering, due to several factors such as the widespread availability of multi-core/parallel architectures and Internet-based systems. This leads to the extension of mainstream object-oriented programming languages and platforms-Java is a main example-with libraries providing fine-grained mechanisms and idioms to support concurrent programming, in particular for building efficient programs. Besides these fine-grained supports, a main research goal in this context is to devise higher-level, coarse-grained abstractions that would help building concurrent programs as pure object-oriented abstractions help building large component-based programs. To this end, in this paper we present simpA, a Java-based framework that provides programmers with agent-oriented  abstractions on top of the basic OO layer, as a means to organize and structure concurrent applications. We first 
describe the API and annotation framework provided to Java programmers for building simpA applications, then we discuss the main features of the approach from a software engineering point of view, by showing some programming examples. Finally, we define an operational semantics formalizing the main aspects of this programming model.},

The suitability of this model is studied by considering a self-adaptive display infrastructure providing people nearby with several visualization services (advertisements, news, personal and social content). The key result of this article is that general-purpose chemical reactions inspired by population dynamics can be used in pervasive applications to enact spatial computing patterns of competition and gradient-based interaction.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The complexity of pervasive computing systems is rapidly increasing, and this calls for service models and coordination approaches intrinsically manifesting self-organisation of component interactions. The goal of this paper is to provide a coordination model (formalised as a process algebra) capturing the relevant aspects of such systems. It should allow the behaviour of large-scale, situated, and self-organising systems to be conveniently expressed, paving the way towards their rigorous study as well as development of supporting platforms. Focussing on the recently introduced concept of pervasive ecosystems, the proposed model revolves around (i) the notion of a distributed and dynamic space of ``live semantic annotations'' (wrapping data, knowledge, and the relevant facts about activities of humans, devices, and services) upon which autonomous agents coordinate and (ii) a small set of chemical-resembling coordination rules that enforce mechanisms of diffusion, aggregation, decay, and bonding between such annotations. },

On this basis, we discuss how such frameworks should get inspiration from natural ecosystems, by enabling modelling and deployment of services as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services, data sources, and pervasive devices. A reference architecture is presented to clarify the concepts expressed, and then several possible approaches to realise the idea are surveyed and critically analyzed.},
